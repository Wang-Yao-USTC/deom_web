This work establishes a strongly correlated system-and-bath dynamics theory, the many-dissipaton density operators formalism. 　

It puts forward a quasi-particle picture for environmental influences.
This picture unifies the physical descriptions and algebraic treatments on three distinct classes of quantum environments, electron bath, phonon bath, and two-level spin or exciton bath, as their participating in quantum dissipation processes.

### Quantum dissipation with nonlinear coupling bath

In this work, we address the key issues toward the solutions to the lowest nonlinear environment, a harmonic bath coupled both linearly and quadratically with an arbitrary system. To determine the bath coupling descriptors, we propose a physical mapping
scheme, together with the prescription reference invariance requirement. 　

We then adopt a recently developed dissipaton equation of motion theory with the underlying statistical quasi-particle (“dissipaton”) algebra being extended to the quadratic
bath coupling.

### DEOM–Based Semiclassical method

We present a semiclassical approach for quantum dissipative dynamics. The dynamical components considered in the developed method are wavepackets’ phase-space moments of not only the primary reduced system density operator but also the auxiliary density operators.
It is a highly numerically efficient method, meanwhile taking into account the high-order effects of system-bath couplings.

### Phase–space dissipaton theory

In this work, we establish the dissipaton algebra on solvation momentums, with rigorous validations against necessary and sufficient criteria.
The resulted phase–spaceDEOM theory will serve as a solid ground for further developments of various practical methods toward a broad range of applications.
